## Requirements

-Problem: Students often suffer as they don't have an all-in-one application to store all their course related information throughout their academic career. Additionally, having to switch between different applications for different information for courses throughout the term becomes a pain point. Our application will solve this problem by providing an all-in-one platform so students can easily store, access and edit such information.

-Users:
Target users: University of Waterloo students who want a platform to keep all course related information.
Persona: Kai is a 20-year old tech savvy undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo. They aim to stay organized and on top of their coursework while balancing other activities. They are always on the lookout for digital tools that can simplify academic tasks. Kaiâ€™s primary goal is to improve time management. However, they struggle to keep track of deadlines and manage course-related information across multiple platforms. An app that combines features such as viewing daily/weekly schedules, having all course information centralized in one place and managing their own information would be a great solution to meet their needs.
Target users feedback: Overall the target users seemed to think such an application would be useful for keeping track of all different course information throughout school. They provided a few ideas:

It would be nice to have the ability to add grades for each component of the courses.   
App should be user friendly and easy to understand, so students don't waste a lot of time
learning how to use this application on top of all the other work they have.   
A To Do list for each course would come in handy

Keeping the scope of the project in mind some we implemented some of the suggestions as is outlined in the list below

-Requirements
The following features were completed as part of this project:
-Signup      
-Login/logout  
-Add a term  
-Search for a term  
-Add a course  
-Search for a course  
-Display details for the course  
-Homepage view where user can search for all previous terms    added by them   
-Note taking functionality for each course         
-To Do list functionality for each course


## Design
The design pattern we tried to adapt was Model-View-ViewModel, this was because after doing some 
research we noticed that this is the most popular desig pattern used for Android Applications. Additionally, none of our team members had 
used this before so we decided it would be a good idea to learn more about it. We decided to use firebase for authentication and firestore 
for storing our data. This turned out to be a good decision as firebase handled authentication for us in a very nice manner. More over, 
Firestore is a NoSQL document based database. Since none of us had used it before, it was initially hard to grasp how documents/collections are
structured but towardds the end of the course we all became proficient in writing different complex queries using firestore. One technical decision we made during the initial stages was to add all the navigation at the end. This decision did not work in our favor
as towards the end we had to make a lot of changes for the navigation to work as we wanted it to. Moreover, a lot of small changes needed to 
be made throughout the codebase to get the navigation to work. 

## Discussion
Since our team had minimal exposure to kotlin & compose before starting the project we frequently referred to the Android Developer 
documentation to understand best practices and learn more. This was also the first time we worked on a project of this nature from start to
end therefore there were a lot of learnings. Weekly meetings, and meeting minutes really helped our team stay organized and focused. Moreover,
pair programming helped us learn new coding techniques from each other. Pair programming also helped us catch flaws earlier in the 
process which were then addressed accordingly. 
A few things we would do differently when creating a project of this nature would be:
-Complete more readings and watch more tutorials before starting to write code. This will ensure our code is more clean and we are
adapting best practices from the start.    
-Add navigation as soon as a new screen is introduced.    
-Set up more time for pair programming we it is really helpful, especially when everyone is learning.     
-Make sure tasks assigned don't overlap during a sprint so two people are not modifying the same file for the same purpose, this results
in a waste of overall group time and effort.     
-Add more tests


## Installation Details
### On Virtual device in Android studio:
1. Clone the project and open it in Android Studio.
2. Build the project by navigating to `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)`.
3. A popup will appear in the bottom right-hand corner; click on 'locate' to find the APK in the debug folder.
4. Navigate to `Device Explorer` in Android Studio, go to `sdcard > Download`, then drag and drop the APK file there.
5. On the virtual device, navigate to `Files > Downloads`. Tap on the APK file to install it, choose 'Update' if prompted, and then 'Open' after installation.

### Course Journal Application Installation Guide
#### Introduction
This guide provides detailed steps for installing and running the Course Journal application on both an Android client and a backend service.

#### Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Docker Desktop
- Git
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher

#### Installing the Android Client
1. Clone the repository using Git: git clone <repository-url>
2. Open Android Studio and select 'Open an existing project', then navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Build the APK by going to `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)` and click on 'locate' to find the APK in the debug folder.
4. Use the 'Device Explorer' in Android Studio to navigate to `sdcard > Download` and drag the APK there.
5. On the virtual or physical device, navigate to `Files > Downloads`, tap on the APK file to install it, and then open the app.

#### Setting Up the Backend Service
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running.
2. Build the Docker container for the backend service with the following commands:
    ```
    cd ktor-346/
    ./gradlew shadowJar
    docker build -t ktor-app .
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-ktor-container ktor-app
    ```
3. Once the docker container is succesfully running you can test  the microservice is running by going to http://localhost:8080/
